The Archives document the autonomous creative processes of nearly hundred artists working at Studio 333 over the past two decades. The sounds, without exception, recorded in High Definition go beyond musical and sound idioms. All phonograms have been prepared with the utmost care using advanced equipment, including many original prototype devices. The idea of using a top-shelf studio to produce off-music and making the results of the work available for free in its entirety is the fulfillment of the idealistic dream of Bartłomiej Kuźniak, who runs the laboratory.

In addition to the Studio 333 Archives website, the upcoming releases will be available on Archive.org and Studio333.bandcamp.com
