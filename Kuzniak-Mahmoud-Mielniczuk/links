Extras:
"Crypto is killing my passion" - version without rythmical section https://studio333.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Kuzniak-Mahmoud-Structrures-behind-the-Crypto.mp3

More extras to prepare:
I'll prepare following audio stems (group of instruments) from "Crypto is killing my passion" track:
- just rhyhmical section (all percussives plus electric double bass)
- just vocals (including choirs with FX)
- just saxophones (with FXes)
I imagine that stems can be placed in VR space in the way which will allow to hear just one of them or mix in between 2 or 3 of them. 

While working on the album, we made a few musical digressions that did not make it into the program of the album, but may be some kind of hidden prizes in the metaverse "Never, Never" for seekers. I need a few days to find them, organize them, possibly mix and master them and put them on the server.
