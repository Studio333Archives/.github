Thomas knows the club where we will play https://berlin.arkaoda.com/
He told me that this is cool place but not his favorite. Many interesting musicians were playing there but the place itself is a basement club, so the celling height is not enough to make any screen to display propper size. There it can be only too small projection screen to be visible for the audience, so I thought that instead of creating one form of VJing for all it maybe be will be possible to cooperate with VR headset producer to hire some devices for the concert for audience to let people taste their individual VR experience (each person can behave differently then and use "Never, Never" Metaverse in a different, individual way, so every visual experience for people with VR headsets will be kind of personal one) while hearing common live sound from the club soundsystem.
